Methods in Java:
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
Is just a collection of java statements and blocks of code like if else, loops, println ect....
1)it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them
build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
2) Methods allow us to reuse codes.
3) Methods allow us to be flexible.
How can we create Methods?
There are two types built-in and user defined.
Built-in methods:
The methods which are designed by Java developers for Exp: printLn() nextInt()  and scanner class length() these are all
built-in methods.
User defined Methods:
The methods that we write.
there is 2 things: methods whchi return something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

int add (int a, int b){
 return a+b;
}
int => return type of a method
 add => name of the method
 (int a,int b) => parameters of the method or the input to the method
 {  => body of the method
 }
Rules:
return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match
we can only assign methods to variables of same type.
******************************************************************************************************
There are tree types of variables with respect to their scope
local variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc. they are
    called local variables.
Upside:
    Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should always try to write code
    with the help of local variables.
Downside:
    They can't be accessed outside the block in which they are created. They have very limited scope.
instance variables:
    All the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables.
upside:
    we can use them in all the instance methods of that class. their scope is larger than local variables.
downside:
    They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.
static variables:
    All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keyword are called static variables.
