Abstraction:
Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user.
In java, we can achieve this in 2 ways 1)Abstract classes 2) interface.
Interface:
  Is very similar to an abstract class. We can have private,static,default,abstract methods we can be static in an interface.
  We can't have instance fields in an interface and because we don't have instance fields we also can't have a constructor in an interface.
  When we should use interface:
  When objects are closely related to each other and there is a "Is a" relationship between classes then we should go with
  abstract classes if we want to use abstraction. if objects are not related to each other than we should implement abstraction with the help of interfaces.
