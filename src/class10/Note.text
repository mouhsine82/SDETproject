Arrays In java:
    Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable. We use indexes to get back the values.
Why we should learn Arrays:
    If we have to store a lot of values. It becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.
Syntax of Arrays:
    We can create arrays in two different ways.
First way of creating arrays:
    Datatype[] arr={element 1,element 2,element 3};
    System.out.println(arr[0])
second way of creating arrays:
    DataType[] arr=new Datatype[Size]
