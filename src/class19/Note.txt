Constructor - block of code similar to a method
that is executed when we create an Object.

Why do we need it? - contructor initializes the object

How to create a constructor?
1. Constructor name MUST be same as a class
2. No return type

Type of the constructors:
non argument
parametrized

this keyword - is used to refer to the current object

this. can be used with variables and methods

this. used to refer to the instance variables
In situation when local variable have same name as instance -> we use this. to differentiate
and refer to the instance variable.

(this) can be used  to refer to the instance methods as well.
this() - can used to call CURRENT class constructor.
