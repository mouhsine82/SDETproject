2D Arrays:
    Are arrays that contain 1D arrays.
Why we should learn about 2D arrays.
    Because they allow us to store multiple one d arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
    for example if we have to store data from Excel files we can use 2D Arrays.
Syntax to create 2D Arrays:
First Way:
    DataType[][] nameOfArray= new DataType[SizeOf Rows][];
Second Way:
    DataType[][] nameOfArray= {{data,data,data},{data,data},{data,data,data,data}};

OOP is nothing but some set of rules that if we follow we achieve below.
    1)  representing real life entities becomes easier.
    2) Code repetition is minimized
    3) Changing existing code and adding new features becomes easier.
    4) Helps write secure code.
